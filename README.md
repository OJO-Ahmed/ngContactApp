A simple contact Application built with AngularJs,firebase where you can create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) contact.

## test link
The project can be accessed/found on this 
https://first-firebase-ec86c.firebaseapp.com

## Getting Started
This project is built with angular seed

### Prerequisites
We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `angular-seed`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


**Before starting Protractor, open a separate terminal window and run:**

```
npm start
```
